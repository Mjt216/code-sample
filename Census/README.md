The Census project was a final exam for my Programming and Data Management class. It uses U.S. census data in anes.csv to answer questions posed by my professor, as well as some of my own.

The code alternates between R and Python each question.

The R Markdown file is the final product. The Python file is the code for one question that I then copied into the Markdown file.

The anes.csv file is unfortunately too large to upload here.
