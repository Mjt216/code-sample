ASAT Testing

### Background
#### Destructive Anti-Satellite (ASAT) Testing

<font size = "5"> Orbital debris has become a larger and larger problem as Earth orbits become more and more crowded. Governments and commercial space actors use highly specific orbits such as Low/Medium/High Earth Orbits (LEO/MEO,HEO), Polar Orbit, and Geostationary Orbit (GEO). Each orbit has specific advantages for different types of spacecraft. Due to the specific altitudes at which satellites are placed into orbit, these areas of space have become quite crowded. Space actors now worry about events like the Kessler Effect, which is a theory that an overcrowded LEO will create a chain reaction of collisions that will generate a permanent field of debris encircling the planet.</font>

<font size = "5"> The recent sharp uptick in launches of spacecraft has brought this problem of orbital debris to the fore. Despite the danger, the world's top space actors - the United States, Russia, China, and India - have conducted destructive anti-satellite (ASAT) testing. This type of testing creates unpredictable debris, sometimes by the thousands. The last test, conducted by China, caused the astronauts on the International Space Station to take shelter in their escape vehicle. ASAT tests can be divided into two categories: direct ascent and co-orbital. Direct ascent describes a projectile or vehicle launched directly at a satellite in space from a rocket on the ground. Co-orbital tests involve a spacecraft conducting maneuvers in orbit to de-orbit or otherwise destroy/damage another satellite.</font>

<font size = "5"> The intent of this portfolio is to gain a better understanding of how destructive ASAT testing has affected the amount of debris in orbit - and therefore how much risk it poses to spacecraft in orbit.</font>

### Data Sources

<font size = "5">**The History of ASAT Tests in Space** is a dataset that contains information about every known anti-satellite (ASAT) test conducted by the United States, Russia, China, and India. It is a product of the Secure World Foundation - a well-known NGO that "envisions the secure, sustainable and peaceful uses of outer space contributing to global stability and benefits on Earth."</font>
