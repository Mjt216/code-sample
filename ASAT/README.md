The Anti-Satellite (ASAT) Test project was done for my Data Visualization course. 

The 'Portfolio' folder contains the final dashboard containing most of the visualizations that I created for the course. It also contains a description of ASAT testing and of the contributing data.

The 'Tableau' folder contains a workbook file with the portfolio proposal and some initial visualizations done in Tableau

The 'Plots' folder contains code for individual visualizations, all of which are in the final portfolio.

The 'Reference' folder contains .csv files necessary to run the code.
